    c.last_message_at,
    u.username
FROM conversation.conversations c
JOIN core.users u ON c.user_id = u.id
WHERE c.deleted_at IS NULL
ORDER BY c.last_message_at DESC;

-- 2. View messages in a specific conversation
-- Replace :conv_id with actual UUID
SELECT role, content, created_at
FROM conversation.messages
WHERE conversation_id = 'REPLACE_WITH_UUID'
ORDER BY created_at ASC;

-- 3. Find unanswered questions (Knowledge Gaps)
SELECT 
    question, 
    search_query, 
    top_similarity_score,
    priority,
    created_at
FROM conversation.unanswered_questions
WHERE resolved = FALSE
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- 4. Check AI sources for a message
SELECT sources
FROM conversation.messages
WHERE role = 'ASSISTANT' AND sources IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
